### Overview of Product Feature Management Entities

UDM offers a framework for managing product features and specifications. Key to this functionality are several interrelated entities: Product, ProductFeature, ProductFeatureType, ProductFeatureAppl, and ProductFeatureApplType.

#### 1. Product Entity
**Purpose**: Represents items for sale or use.

**Key Attributes**:
- Product ID: Unique identifier.
- Product Name.
- Description.
- Product Type.
- Price.
- Quantity.

#### 2. ProductFeature Entity
**Purpose**: Specifies attributes or characteristics of a product.

**Key Attributes**:
- Product Feature ID: Unique identifier.
- Product Feature Type ID: Linked to ProductFeatureType.
- Description.

#### 3. ProductFeatureType Entity
**Purpose**: Classifies product features.

**Key Attributes**:
- Product Feature Type ID: Unique identifier.
- Parent Type Id 
- Description.

#### 4. ProductFeatureAppl Entity
**Purpose**: Links a ProductFeature to a Product, facilitating a many-to-many relationship.

**Key Attributes**:
- Product ID.
- Product Feature ID.
- Product Feature Appl Type ID
- From Date and Thru Date: Applicability period.
- Sequence Number.
- Amount.

#### 5. ProductFeatureApplType Entity
**Purpose**: Defines the nature of feature application to a product.

**Key Attributes**:
- Product Feature Appl Type ID: Unique identifier.
- Parent Type ID 
- Description.

#### Common ProductFeatureApplType Values:
1. **DISTINGUISHING_FEAT**: For unique or characteristic features that distinguish one product from another.
2. **OPTIONAL_FEATURE**: Represents add-on features that are not essential but can be chosen by the user.
3. **REQUIRED_FEATURE**: Essential features necessary for the productâ€™s operation.
4. **SELECTABLE_FEATURE**: Features that offer multiple options, require a selection.
5. **STANDARD_FEATURE**: Standard features included in every unit of the product.

### Utilizing Entities for Product Feature Definition

1. **Define ProductFeatureType**: Classify the feature.
2. **Define ProductFeature**: Create a feature with specific details.
3. **Link Feature to Product using ProductFeatureAppl**: Associate the feature with a product, detailing applicability and sequence.
4. **Specify Feature Application using ProductFeatureApplType**: Clarify the nature of the feature's application, whether it's standard, optional, required, distinguishing, or selectable.

### The Relationships between these entities -- 
1. **Product to ProductFeatureAppl** :  Many to one
2. **ProductFeatureAppl to ProductFeature** : one to many
3. **ProductFeature to ProductFeatureType** : one to many
4. **ProductFeatureAppl to ProductFeatureApplType** one to many

**Activity:** 
**Discuss** ProductFeatureAppl and ProductFeatureApplTypes entities and analyse similarity with ProductAssoc and ProductAssocType entities.

* ProductFeatureAppl entity is used to establish relationship between Product and ProductFeature entity. Many products can have multiple features governing many to many relationship
* ProductFeatureApplType entity defines the meta data or characteristics of a product feature, It can be OPTIONAL_FEATURE, REQUIRED_FEATURE, SELECTABLE_FEATURE, STANDARD_FEATURE
* Similarly, ProductAssoc is ued to establish relationship between multiple Products. A product can be related to another product with some several types For example: Complementary Product, Also Bought Together, Upgrade Product, Product Variant. These types are defined in ProductAssocType entity
