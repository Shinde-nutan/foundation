- Product Type.
- Price.
- Quantity.

#### 2. ProductFeature Entity

#### 5. ProductFeatureApplType Entity
**Purpose**: Defines the nature of feature application to a product.

- Description.

#### Common ProductFeatureApplType Values:
1. **DISTINGUISHING_FEAT**: For unique or characteristic features that distinguish one product from another.
2. **OPTIONAL_FEATURE**: Represents add-on features that are not essential but can be chosen by the user.
3. **REQUIRED_FEATURE**: Essential features necessary for the productâ€™s operation.
4. **SELECTABLE_FEATURE**: Features that offer multiple options, requiring a selection.
5. **STANDARD_FEATURE**: Standard features included in every unit of the product.

### Utilizing Entities for Product Feature Definition

1. **Define ProductFeatureType**: Classify the feature.
2. **Define ProductFeature**: Create a feature with specific details.
3. **Link Feature to Product using ProductFeatureAppl**: Associate the feature with a product, detailing applicability and sequence.
4. **Specify Feature Application using ProductFeatureApplType**: Clarify the nature of the feature's application, whether it's standard, optional, required, distinguishing, or selectable.

**Activity:** 
**Discuss** ProductFeatureAppl and ProductFeatureApplTypes entities and analyse similarity with ProductAssoc and ProductAssocType entities.

- Both ProductFeatureAppl and ProductAssoc entities are used to establish relationships between different aspects of products.
- While ProductFeatureAppl deals with linking specific features to a product (e.g., color, size), ProductAssoc deals with relationships between entire products.
- The ProductFeatureApplType entity and ProductAssocType entity serve similar roles in classifying the nature of these associations (e.g., standard features, optional features, required features, etc.).
